Modal Deployment Guide

Modal is a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and scale machine learning models and applications. It provides serverless infrastructure that automatically handles scaling, resource management, and deployment.

Key Features:
1. Serverless Functions: Deploy code as serverless functions that scale automatically
2. GPU Support: Access to high-performance GPUs for ML workloads
3. Container Support: Deploy containerized applications
4. Easy Integration: Simple Python decorators for deployment

Deploying LLMs on Modal:
- Use @app.function() decorator to define serverless functions
- Specify GPU requirements with gpu="A10G" or similar
- Handle model loading and inference in the function
- Expose HTTP endpoints with @app.web_endpoint()

Benefits:
- No infrastructure management
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Fast cold start times
- Built-in monitoring and logging

Modal is particularly well-suited for deploying large language models like Qwen because it can handle the computational requirements and provide scalable inference endpoints.
