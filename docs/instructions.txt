# Investment Basics

Investing is the process of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. Common investment types include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate.

## Stocks
Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a share of that company's assets and earnings.

## Bonds
Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.
